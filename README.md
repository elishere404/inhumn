# Introduction, in a nutshell

"inhumn" lets you deploy databases very simply, we're in progress

## Create Your DB 

Our site is not ready yet, to create so, go to {site-url}/dashboard/, click the create new button, this should create a new Database, which can be used for alot of things, such as:
### Login/Signup Forms
### Publishing posts, like reddit
What you can do with a found-database:
### Report if suspicious
We generated excel files so you could report if the form is suspicious
